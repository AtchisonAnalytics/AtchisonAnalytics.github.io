        <h2>MARKET OVERVIEW - August 2025</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>August delivered broad gains across global equities and bonds, driven by actual and expected rate cuts.</li>
            <li>9 of 11 S&P/ASX 200 sectors advanced, with Materials and Consumer Discretionary leading gains. Meanwhile Health Care fell 13% due to a CSL sell-off following its spinoff announcement. Information Technology remained under pressure.</li>
            <li>Value, Equal Weight, and High Dividend each rose 6%. Growth lagged as the weakest performer year-to-date.</li>
            <li>Chinese equities outperformed, as onshore markets rebounded and narrowed the gap with offshore stocks.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities recorded a fourth consecutive month of gains, with the S&P 500 rising 2% in August, despite a sharp final-day sell-off. Market sentiment was supported by optimism around potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and continued strength in Big Tech.</li>
            <li>The rally broadened across market segments, with mid- and small-cap stocks outperforming large caps.</li>
            <li>Most sectors posted positive returns, led by Materials and Health Care; Health Care recovered losses from July. Utilities was the only sector to decline.</li>
            <li>European equities gained for the month, extending their positive run for the quarter. Sector leaders were Health Care (+4%+) and Consumer Staples (+3%+). Information Technology, Utilities, and Industrials posted modest losses of under 2%, not enough to offset the index's overall gains.</li>
            <li>US fixed income indices all posted gains amid fluctuating yields and shifting rate expectations.</li>
            <li>The Reserve Bank of Australia and Reserve Bank of New Zealand each reduced key rates by 25bps.</li>
            <li>Commodities participated in the rally, led by Livestock. Precious Metals strengthened, with Gold reaching another record high, driven by renewed safe-haven demand.</li>           
        </ul>
