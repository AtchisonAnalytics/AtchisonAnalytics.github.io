                        <h4>Current Major Economic Regime Position</h4>
                        <p>The below chart provides current signal positioning across major economies. The large circles represent the latest datapoint with the trail showing their paths over the last 12 months.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>US Regime remains resilient, with 4th month of growth indicators landing above the line, continuing the current trend of indicator improvements since Liberation Day fears.</li>
                            <li>Europe, Australia and UK all remain type 1 with improving fundamental signals.</li>
                            <li>China remains in falling growth territory, however relative improvement has occurred in the last month.</li>
                            <li>Japan maintains a spike in growth signals, and is looking like it will transition from Type 2 to Type 1 as early inflation peak signals appear.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <p>Our model trades as a 6-18 month time horizon. Relative to recent positions, the model suggests overweight developed equities, particuarly US, and a relative increase of Japanese betas.</p>

                        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

                        <p>Proprietary research has built a signal model to identify key current economic conditions on a Country-by-Country basis that then provides predictive power regarding expected forward equity market returns.</p>
                        <p>The intent is to provide repeatable insights as to the relative attractiveness of major global equity markets – as well as assist in the decision regarding timing of active management decisions – whether expressed via use of Country or Industry specific ETFs or via selection of Active Managers.</p>
                        <p>Significant research highlights persistent underlying factors within equity market driving absolute and relative attractiveness of different strategies.</p>
                        <p>Further details regarding our method applied and current regime settings are provided below.</p>

                        <h2>MARKET OVERVIEW - August 2025</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>August delivered broad gains across global equities and bonds, driven by actual and expected rate cuts.</li>
            <li>9 of 11 S&P/ASX 200 sectors advanced, with Materials and Consumer Discretionary leading gains. Meanwhile Health Care fell 13% due to a CSL sell-off following its spinoff announcement. Information Technology remained under pressure.</li>
            <li>Value, Equal Weight, and High Dividend each rose 6%. Growth lagged as the weakest performer year-to-date.</li>
            <li>Chinese equities outperformed, as onshore markets rebounded and narrowed the gap with offshore stocks.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities recorded a fourth consecutive month of gains, with the S&P 500 rising 2% in August, despite a sharp final-day sell-off. Market sentiment was supported by optimism around potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and continued strength in Big Tech.</li>
            <li>The rally broadened across market segments, with mid- and small-cap stocks outperforming large caps.</li>
            <li>Most sectors posted positive returns, led by Materials and Health Care; Health Care recovered losses from July. Utilities was the only sector to decline.</li>
            <li>European equities gained for the month, extending their positive run for the quarter. Sector leaders were Health Care (+4%+) and Consumer Staples (+3%+). Information Technology, Utilities, and Industrials posted modest losses of under 2%, not enough to offset the index’s overall gains.</li>
            <li>US fixed income indices all posted gains amid fluctuating yields and shifting rate expectations.</li>
            <li>The Reserve Bank of Australia and Reserve Bank of New Zealand each reduced key rates by 25bps.</li>
            <li>Commodities participated in the rally, led by Livestock. Precious Metals strengthened, with Gold reaching another record high, driven by renewed safe-haven demand.</li>
                        </ul>
