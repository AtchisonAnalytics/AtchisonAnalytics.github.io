                            <li>Japan maintains a spike in growth signals and improving inflation outlook, and has transition from Type 4 (worst) to Type 1 (best) within last 4 months.</li>
                            <li>China remains in neutral growth territory, however relative improvement has occurred in the 2 months.</li>
                            <li>Mexico has been added to the analysis - with very strong signals being recorded for the last 5 months.</li>

                        <p>Proprietary research has built a signal model to identify key current economic conditions on a Country-by-Country basis that then provides predictive power regarding expected forward equity market returns.</p>
                        <p>The intent is to provide repeatable insights as to the relative attractiveness of major global equity markets – as well as assist in the decision regarding timing of active management decisions – whether expressed via use of Country or Industry specific ETFs or via selection of Active Managers.</p>
                        <p>Significant research highlights persistent underlying factors within equity market driving absolute and relative attractiveness of different strategies.</p>
                        <p>Further details regarding our method applied and current regime settings are provided below.</p>

                        <h2>MARKET OVERVIEW - September 2025</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>September saw global equities extend their rally, supported by the start of the U.S. easing cycle and improving growth sentiment. Bonds also gained as yields moved lower, particularly at the long end of the curve.</li>
                            <li>The S&P/ASX 200 declined 0.8% in September, snapping its five-month winning streak. 9 out of 11 sectors reported losses with financials falling 1.4% detracting meaningfully given their index weight. Energy took the biggest fall returning -9.8% on the back of lower oil price. </li>
                            <li>Materials stood out as the strongest performer on the ASX, rising 6.1% on the back of strength in gold and diversified miners.</li>
                            <li>Emerging markets (+5.7%), particularly China (China Top 50 +6.7%), outperformed developed peers. Improving macro data and continued policy support underpinned performance. </li>
                            <li>U.S. equities recorded a fifth consecutive month of gains. The S&P 500 posted its best September month in 15 years, gaining 3.7%, in what has historically been the worst month for stocks. This was supported by a Federal Reserve rate cut.</li>
                            <li>Large cap equities outperformed mid and smalls in the US. Growth was the dominant factor outperforming value.</li>
                            <li>Sector performance was split in September, with Technology leading the way, bouncing back from a negative August, advancing over 7.5%. Consumer Staples, Materials, and Energy all went negative, with Financials virtually flat at 0.1% in September.</li>
                            <li>European equities advanced 1% for September continuing their positive run. However, german equities have been a drag for the quarter falling 1.2% behind political uncertainty.</li>
                            <li>The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 25bps in September 2025, bringing it to the 4.00%-4.25% range, in line with expectations. It is the first reduction in borrowing costs since December.</li>
                            <li>The RBA decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent at its September meeting. Bond indices were positive or neutral for the month.</li>
                            <li>Commodites exteneded their rally. Gold reached record highs and copper saw a surge in prices. Rare earths performed well due to supply chain strain.</li>
