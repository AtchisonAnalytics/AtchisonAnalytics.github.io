                        <p>Proprietary research has built a signal model to identify key current economic conditions on a Country-by-Country basis that then provides predictive power regarding expected forward equity market returns.</p>
                        <p>The intent is to provide repeatable insights as to the relative attractiveness of major global equity markets – as well as assist in the decision regarding timing of active management decisions – whether expressed via use of Country or Industry specific ETFs or via selection of Active Managers.</p>
                        <p>Significant research highlights persistent underlying factors within equity market driving absolute and relative attractiveness of different strategies.</p>
                        <p>Further details regarding our method applied and current regime settings are provided below.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>US Regime is deteriating, with 2nd month of growth indicators falling below the line, continuing the current trend of being relatively less attractive.</li>
                            <li>The underlying US economy is still relatively strong relative to fear in equity markets.</li>
                            <li>Europe, China and UK all remain type 1 with improving fundamental signals.</li>
                            <li>Japan has had a spike in growth signals, moving from Type 4 (typically the worst regime for equities) to Type 2.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <p>Our model trades as a 6-18 month time horizon. Relative to recent positions, the model suggests reduction of US equities and increase of Japanese betas.</p>

                        <h2>MARKET OVERVIEW - April 2025</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Australian share market recorded its first monthly gain since January returning 3.6% for the month of April and 9.8% for the 12 months. The Australia market followed the lead from the US share market on news of trade deals.</li>
                            <li>Australia copped a 10% US tariff on our exports, however only 5% of Australian exports go to the US. The bigger threat to Australian exports comes from reduced exports to China and Asia.</li>
                            <li>10 out of 11 sectors in the S&P/ASX 200 posted gains, led by Communication Services, Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary, each rising by 6%. Energy was the only sector to report a loss.</li>
                            <li>China's manufacturing sector contracted in April, with the official PMI falling to 49.0, its lowest since December 2023, due to escalating U.S. tariffs and weakening export demand.</li>
                            <li>Trump placed eye-watering 145% tariff on China but for most other nations a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, leaving a 10% universal tariff in place.</li>
                            <li>Global share markets plunged at the beginning of the month on worries about a full-blown trade war, The Trump Dump initially caused US shares to fall 17%, 16% globally and 10% in Australia. While gold surged to new highs.</li>
                            <li>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the Federal Funds Rate unchanged at the range of 4.25 – 4.50% at the March meeting and projected two rate cuts later this year.</li>
                            <li>The RBA left interest rates on hold at 4.10%, but is expected to engage in another rate cut of 0.25% in May. Australia’s headline inflation (total inflation) remained steady in Q1 2025 at 2.4% annually, within the target band of 2 – 3%. </li>
                            <li>Most fixed income indices advanced as rates declined on weaker economic growth expectations. The Australian Government 0+ index was among the best performers, rising by 2% for the month, with the index's yield falling to 4%.</li>
                            <li>Gold maintained its winning streak in 2025, reaching historic peak of US$3,500 per ounce before experiencing volatility. A significant driver behind’s gold’s stellar performance has been the substantial decline in the US dollar.</li>
                        </ul>
