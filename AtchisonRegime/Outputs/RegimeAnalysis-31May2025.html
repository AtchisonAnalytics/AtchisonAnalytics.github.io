                        <p>Proprietary research has built a signal model to identify key current economic conditions on a Country-by-Country basis that then provides predictive power regarding expected forward equity market returns.</p>
                        <p>The intent is to provide repeatable insights as to the relative attractiveness of major global equity markets – as well as assist in the decision regarding timing of active management decisions – whether expressed via use of Country or Industry specific ETFs or via selection of Active Managers.</p>
                        <p>Significant research highlights persistent underlying factors within equity market driving absolute and relative attractiveness of different strategies.</p>
                        <p>Further details regarding our method applied and current regime settings are provided below.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>US Regime is deteriating, with 2nd month of growth indicators falling below the line, continuing the current trend of being relatively less attractive.</li>
                            <li>The underlying US economy is still relatively strong relative to fear in equity markets.</li>
                            <li>Europe, China and UK all remain type 1 with improving fundamental signals.</li>
                            <li>Japan has had a spike in growth signals, moving from Type 4 (typically the worst regime for equities) to Type 2.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <p>Our model trades as a 6-18 month time horizon. Relative to recent positions, the model suggests reduction of US equities and increase of Japanese betas.</p>

                        <h2>MARKET OVERVIEW - April 2025</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Smaller companies outperformed their broader counterparts, with the Small Ordinaries rising 6%, whilst the ASX 200 advanced 4%</li>
                            <li>All sectors within the ASX 200 recorded gains. Information Technology led with a 20% jump, followed by Energy at 9%, while traditionally defensive sectors - Utilities, Consumer Staples, and Health Care lagged.</li>
                            <li>All Australian factor indices ended the month in positive territory. Momentum, Equal Weight, and Growth factors outpaced others, whereas High Dividend and Value underperformed, echoing sector-level trends.</li>
                            <li>China’s equity markets posted solid gains in May 2025, supported by tech earnings and fresh monetary easing, including rate and reserve ratio cuts. However, mixed economic data and external pressures, such as weaker U.S. exports, highlight ongoing structural and geopolitical challenges.</li>
                            <li>U.S. equities staged a strong rebound in May, driven by renewed optimism over easing trade tensions. The S&P 500 rose 6%, marking its best May performance since 1990. Solid earnings from major technology firms also propelled the rally. </li>
                            <li>Most sectors registered gains, led by Information Technology and Communication Services, which rose 11% and 10% respectively. Health Care was the notable underperformer.</li>
                            <li>Risk appetite continued to improve, with Momentum, High Beta, and Growth factors leading for the second consecutive month, reflecting a continued rotation away from defensiveness.</li>
                            <li>European equities maintained their positive trajectory, with the European Index gaining approximately 11% year-to-date, outperforming the U.S. market. This performance was supported by easing trade tensions and investor optimism.</li>
                            <li>In May, the RBA cut rates for the second time this year, and delivered a dovish outlook, but Australian bond yields still rose, driven by global market forces including rising yields in the U.S. and Japan.</li>
                            <li>U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply following a weak 20-year note auction and persistent fiscal concerns. As a result, the U.S. Treasury Bond Index declined by 1% in May, its first monthly loss of the year.</li>
                            <li>Within commodities, Energy and Livestock were standout performers. Meanwhile, safe-haven demand for Gold was mixed, leading to slight underperformance in Precious Metals over the month.</li>
                        </ul>
