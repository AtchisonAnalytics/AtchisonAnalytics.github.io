        <h2>MARKET OVERVIEW - February 2025</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The main event locally in February was the Reserve Bank finally cutting the official cash rate by 0.25% to 4.10%. The quarter point reduction was the first by the RBA since late 2020 and reverses the isolated hike in November 2023.</li>
            <li>In financial markets, investors pared back expectations of further official interest rate cuts, including US Federal Reserve on the uptick in inflation. Markets also trimmed futures market pricing for further rate cuts in Australia.</li>
            <li>President Trump's flurry of executive orders dominated the global news flow in February. The most contentious being new tariffs on imports to the US from Canada, Mexico and China, alongside threatened tariffs on European exports.</li>
            <li>The ASX 200 dropped -4.2% in February. Cyclical sectors led the losses, with Technology (-12.3%), Financials (-4.4%) and Consumer Discretionary (-3.1%) all suffering, while defensive sectors such as Consumer Staples (+1.5%) and Utilities (+3.2%) fared better.</li>
            <li>Nearly 70% of major Australian companies have now reported December half earnings - bad news from the banks and resources companies but most companies are doing better</li>
            <li>Another strong jobs report for January. Australian employment rose again by a stronger than expected 44,000, underemployment remained around its 2022 lows. Participation rate and share of population in employment rose.</li>
            <li>The MSCI AC World fell -0.8% in February. Developed markets underperformed with a -0.9% return, dragged lower mainly by the US. Europe rallied further in February up +3.1% as strength came from recovering cyclical data</li>
            <li>In the US, the S&P 500 hit record highs mid-month, but reversed earlier strength towards the end of the month.to end up -1.4% down, with the technology laden NASDAQ off -4.0%. Defensive stocks outperformed.</li>
            <li>Emerging markets' performance of +0.8% was driven by a strong China market, with MSCI China and Hang Seng delivering +11.7% and +13.4% returns, respectively, buoyed by tailwinds from the AI theme and President Xi's meeting with technology leaders.</li>          
            <li>Gold prices hit another record high USD 2.835/oz at month end as tariff risks fuelled demand for safe-haven assets.</li>  
            <li>Brent crude oil fell-4.0% to USD 74.05 per barrel as potential Russian-Ukraine truce helps supply expectations and OPEC announcing increase in oil production.</li>  
        </ul>
