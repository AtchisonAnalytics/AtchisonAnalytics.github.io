        <h2>MARKET OVERVIEW - March 2025</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Australian share market took a lead from the US share market and dropped -3.3% in March on fears of a global trade war and intensifying fears of recession. Recent events highlight the challenges our economy faces, namely our reliance on exports to China. Australia sends around 35% of its iron ore to China.</li>
            <li>The Trump administration scheduled to announce at the beginning of April a raft of new reciprocal tariffs on trading partners worldwide. The size and extent of those tariffs remained unknown, and that kind of uncertainty did zero to boost investor sentiment.</li>
            <li>Markets interpreted the expected new tariffs as the catalyst to crimp global economic growth and potentially reignite inflation, leading to fewer than originally expected interest rate cuts over CY 2025.</li>
            <li>More recent views (post March 2025) are that after the dust settles, effective tariffs on US imports could settle around 15% next year, compared to figures currently pushed out by the Trump administration, 15% doesn't seem that high, but still the highest in almost a century.</li>
            <li>Global market fell -5.0% in the month March led by the US S&P 500 Index down -6.2%. The tech-heavy NASDAQ benchmark was down -8.2% for the month. European markets fared slightly better, benefiting from ongoing rotation from investors seeking alternatives to the US. The STOXX Europe 600 benchmark was down -3.7%.</li>
            <li>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has previously noted that the enduring strength in employment was a potential roadblock to further rate cuts. In the US, the Federal Reserve maintained rates at the current level with minimal changes to the dot-plot projections. The US dollar continued to weaken against major currencies.</li>
            <li>The monthly CPI indicator rose +2.4% in the 12 months to February. Largest contributors to the annual movement were Food and non-alcoholic beverages (+3.1%), Alcohol and tobacco (+6.7%), and Housing (+1.8%).</li>
            <li>Bond yields rose slightly in March, the Australian 10-year bond rate was up 13 bps to 4.42% bps. Whilst US 10-year bond edged up 1 bps to 4.21% but was higher mid-month.</li> 
            <li>Gold continued to hit record highs with the yellow metal topping US$3000 for the first time and closing about US$3100.</li>   
        </ul>
