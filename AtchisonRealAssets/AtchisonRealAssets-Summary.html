                                <h2>MARKET OVERVIEW - July 2024</h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Australia's share market made history in July closing above eight thousand points for the first time buoyed by hopes that the US is on the verge of cutting interest rates.</li>
                                    <li>Seasonally, July is one of the best months of year for Australian equity returns, and July continued that trend returning +4.2% for the month and +13.4% for the year.</li>
                                    <li>Towards the end of the month weaker than expected Australian inflation numbers (0.8% trimmed mean q-o-q) removed the risk of a near term interest rate hike. Expectations the next move will be down in the first half of CY2025.</li>
                                    <li>Australiaâ€™s bond market is currently only pricing a 16% chance that the RBA will lift interest rates to 4.6% in August. </li>
                                    <li>Australian unemployment rate increased slightly from 4.0% to 4.1% and future indicators point to upward trend.</li>
                                    <li>The shift in the expected timing of interest rate change weighed on the AUD/USD which fell 1.9% to 65.41c.</li>
                                    <li>Australian house prices continued to rise unevenly across Australia. Nationally, house prices rose by +0.5% m/m or +7.9% y/y. Perth prices were the strongest out of the capital cities in July, up +0.5% m/m or +7.9% y/y.</li>
                                    <li>Australian building approvals fell in June (-6.5% m/m) and remain at an exceptionally low level.</li>
                                    <li>Biden was withdrawing in favour of Kamala Harris, and whether Jerome Powell, Fed Chair would hint when US rate cuts from current 5.5% would start to fall, given US inflation fell to 3%.</li>
                                    <li>The US market is now pricing in five interest rate cuts in the US over the next 12 months commencing in September.</li>
                                    <li>The broad global equity market returned +4.1%, but the smaller company version was even higher, returning +9.3%.</li>
                                    <li>Against the backdrop of potential falling rates, interest sensitive assets outperformed growth and large cap equity indices.</li>
                                    <li>European Central Banks left rates unchanged. European inflation unexpectantly rose in July to 2.6%.</li>
                                    <li>Commodities broadly fell but precious metals rose. Steel making commodities suffered as prices fell -8%, impacted by soft Chinese property data and high Chinese (iron ore) port stocks.</li>
                                </ul>
