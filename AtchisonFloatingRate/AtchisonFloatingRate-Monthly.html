                        <ul>
                            <li>Recent ABS release shows Australian inflation surprisingly on the upside. Contrary to expectations the uptick on the Monthly Inflation Indicator to 3.6% y-o-y from 3.5% y-o-y was driven by increases in food prices, tobacco, health insurance premiums and fuel.</li>
                            <li>This uptick in Australian inflation keeps the risk of another RBA rate hike and rates for longer on the table.  RBA kept rates at 4.35% over May.</li>
                            <li>Consistent with poor levels of consumer confidence, Australian retail sales rose less than expected 0.1% in April after a 0.4% fall in March.</li>
                            <li>A second consecutive budget surplus delivered cost of living relief to Australian households, but arguably could be inflationary.</li>
                            <li>Construction activity, retail sales and building approvals recorded soft results. CoreLogic home price data showed a lift in average price growth for the five big capital cities to 0.8% in May.</li>
                            <li>US rates remained unchanged at 5.5% while unemployment rose marginally to 3.9%.</li>
                            <li>The run-up to the 5 November US election typically generates significant interest and can influence market volatility, regardless of the candidates involved.</li>
                            <li>US corporates continued to surpass expectations reporting another solid set of quarterly figures, with Q1 earnings growing 7.8% y-o-y.</li>
                            <li>Eurozone unemployment fell to 6.4% in April and there are signs that sentiment is improving and there is a chance that the ECB will cut the interest rate down from 4% for the first time in five years.</li>
                            <li>May was a good month for returns from both equities and fixed income. Investor optimism about economic outlook supported risk assets such as shares.</li>
                            <li>Developed market stocks (hedged) delivered +4.3% over the month and global bonds also generated positive performance of +1.3%, founded on anticipation of rate cuts.</li>
                            <li>Global share markets rebounded from their April negative returns, with the US leading the way returning +4.8% for the month whilst the Australian share market produced a return of +0.9% on the back of stronger than expected inflation numbers and weak consumer company updates.</li>
                            <li>After peaking in April, oil prices retreated in May however the broader commodity indices still delivered positive returns of around 1.7%, based on solid global demand and on-going conflicts in both Middle East and Ukraine.</li>
                        </ul>
