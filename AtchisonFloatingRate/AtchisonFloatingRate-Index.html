        <h2>MARKET OVERVIEW - August 2024</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Australian equity market faced pressure from softer commodity prices, particularly in the energy and materials sectors. The Reserve Bank of Australia's decision to keep interest rates steady was largely anticipated, but concerns over a slowing domestic economy weighed on investor sentiment.</li>
            <li>The S&P 500 in August finished higher, showing gains of 2.3%. The breadth of market gains across different sectors was noted with 9 of eleven sectors finishing in positive territory – lifted mostly from Consumer Staples, Real Estate, Healthcare, Utilities and Financials. </li>
            <li>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 3.87% to end the month of August continuing its recovery after dipping to over-one-year lows of 3.8% earlier in the week, as markets analysed the latest data for clues on the scale of the Federal Reserve's anticipated rate cuts. </li>
            <li>Core PCE prices, the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation, rose by 0.2% in July compared to the previous month, in line with expectations, mirroring the modest increase in the headline index. </li>
            <li>The absence of unexpected increases has reinforced expectations that the Fed will implement 100bps in rate cuts across its three remaining meetings this year. However, monthly gains in personal income and spending have bolstered the view that the US economy remains generally resilient to high borrowing costs, especially following the upward revision of the US GDP. </li>
            <li>Developed markets outside the U.S. showed mixed performance, with European equities showing sluggish advancements as the United Kingdom, Europe, Mid-caps, and small-caps all advanced - but modestly between 0.87% and 1.63% in the month of August.  </li>
            <li>Emerging markets remained mostly subdued, weighed down by weak economic data from China, including disappointing business confidence, manufacturing activity, and services activity. </li>
            <li>Alternative investments, including hedge funds and private equity, provided a mixed performance in August. Hedge funds with market-neutral strategies fared relatively well amid equity market volatility, while private equity faced challenges due to elevated borrowing costs and a more cautious deal-making environment.</li>
            <li>Infrastructure assets remain relatively stable. Inflation-linked infrastructure, such as utilities and transport, benefited from ongoing demand and their inflation-hedging characteristics. </li>
        </ul>
